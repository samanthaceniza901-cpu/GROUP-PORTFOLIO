    <h2>✨ Pia’s Portfolio ✨</h2>
    <p>
      Hiya! I’m Sofija Katreena Paragoso, but everyone calls me Pia. <br>I’m 25 years old and a third-year Multimedia Arts student who loves illustration, character design, and storyboarding. <br>I enjoy working with vibrant warm tones and bold colors to make my art feel lively and expressive.<br> I’m also inspired by trendy, fashion-forward, and girl-centered media, which often influence the style and themes of my work.

      <h3>Character Designs</h3>
      <p>My character designs often reflect my mood and the story I want to tell. Sometimes they’re heavily accessorized, bold, and full of personality, while other times they’re warm, simple, and irresistibly cute. I love exploring both styles to keep my designs expressive and fun.

      <h3>Illustrations</h3>
      <p>My illustrations are often inspired by my daily life experiences, turning simple moments into something fun and expressive. I love using vibrant colors and lively compositions to make each piece feel relatable and full of emotion. Through my art, I aim to make viewers smile or see a bit of themselves in my work.
