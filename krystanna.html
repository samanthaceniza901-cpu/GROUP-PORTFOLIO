      <h3>My Online Avatar</h3>
      <p>My online avatar in various colors. The default one is purple. I enjoyed experimenting with color combinations and assigning themes to each avatar (purple = ube, pink = cherry, orange = pumpkin/squash, and yellow = mango float). The purple avatar actually went through several redesigns as she is the oldest character design I came up with, but her signature purple hair is constantly present.

      <h3>Psyduck</h3>
      <p>A Psyduck-themed beret design I created. Not affiliated with any projects, just a fun illustration.

      <h3>Iono</h3>
      <p>Fan art for the character Iono from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Iono is one of my favorite characters in the game, and drawing her was enjoyable. Because her design was fun to draw, I definitely have more than one illustration of her.

      <h3>Tang</h3>
      <p>Redesign for a popular drink brand Tang. This was supposed to be for a school project but ultimately did not get chosen. No worries, I just kept it as I enjoyed the blend of colors.

      <h3>Bea</h3>
      <p>Character self-portrait for the Webtoon/Wattpad series Dark Moon: The Grey City. This character’s name is Bea (pronounced “bee”) and she is an exchange student for Greyville Secondary High School. This character (excluding the uniform) is actually one of my oldest character designs, but went by a different name, Deborah.

      <h3>Ryka</h3>
      <p>Character sheet of a fanmade character I conceptualized for a Webtoon/Wattpad series Dark Moon: The Blood Altar. Because I focused on the design, I still have not conceptualized her lore, but do know she is a student athlete born into a wealthy family.
